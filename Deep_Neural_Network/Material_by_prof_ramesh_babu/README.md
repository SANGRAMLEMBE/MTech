# Student Schedule Sync

A collaborative repository for students to synchronize and manage weekly schedules.

## Overview

This repository helps students coordinate their schedules by providing a shared space where weekly schedules can be tracked, updated, and synchronized across the group.

## Repository Structure

```

├── 2week-Aug18-Aug22/     # Week 2 schedule

```

Each week folder contains schedules and related materials for that specific time period.
