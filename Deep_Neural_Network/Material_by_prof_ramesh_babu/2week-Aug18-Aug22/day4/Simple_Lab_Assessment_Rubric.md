## ⚡ **QUICK GRADING GUIDE**

### **Time per Student: ~5 minutes**

1. **Run their notebooks** (2 mins) - Do they execute without errors?
2. **Ask 2-3 questions** (2 mins) - "What does this tensor shape mean?" "Why use ReLU here?"
3. **Check one modification** (1 min) - "Change the hidden layer to size 5"

### **Red Flags 🚨**
- Can't explain what their own code does
- Notebooks won't run due to basic errors
- No understanding of tensor shapes
- Copied code without comprehension

### **Excellence Indicators 🌟**
- Adds creative modifications
- Helps other students debug
- Asks thoughtful questions
- Code is well-documented
