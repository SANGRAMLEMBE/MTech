## ‚ùì **Anticipated Student Questions & Answers**

### **Hour 1 Theory Questions**

**Q: "How is this different from traditional programming?"**
**A:** "Traditional programming: we write explicit rules. Neural networks: we provide examples and let the computer figure out the rules."

**Q: "Why can't we just use if-statements for XOR?"**
**A:** "We could! But imagine recognizing faces - you'd need billions of if-statements. Neural networks learn these patterns automatically."

**Q: "How do we know what weights to use?"**
**A:** "Great question! We don't choose them manually. Training algorithms automatically find optimal weights - that's what we'll see in Hour 2."

**Q: "Is this really how brains work?"**
**A:** "It's inspired by brains but greatly simplified. Real neurons are much more complex, but this captures the essential computation."

### **Hour 2 Programming Questions**

**Q: "Why is my code not working?"**
**A:** "Let's check together - common issues are data types, tensor shapes, or typos. Debugging is part of learning!"

**Q: "What if the network doesn't learn XOR?"**
**A:** "Try more training epochs, check the learning rate, or verify your data. Sometimes networks need more time to converge."

**Q: "Can we solve bigger problems than XOR?"**
**A:** "Absolutely! The same principles scale to image recognition, language translation, game playing. XOR is just the foundation."

## üö® **Potential Challenges & Solutions**

### **Technical Challenges**
**Challenge**: Google Colab connectivity issues  
**Solution**: Have backup Jupyter notebooks, screenshots of expected outputs

**Challenge**: Students with different programming backgrounds  
**Solution**: Pair experienced with beginners, provide extra syntax help

**Challenge**: Mathematical concepts too abstract  
**Solution**: Use more analogies, visual diagrams, real-world examples

### **Timing Challenges**

**Challenge**: Students need more time with concepts  
**Solution**: Extend breaks if needed, carry advanced topics to next class

### **Engagement Challenges**
**Challenge**: Students seem lost or overwhelmed  
**Solution**: Check in frequently, use simpler analogies, break into smaller steps
